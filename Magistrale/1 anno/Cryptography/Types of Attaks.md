In *Cryptoanalysis* we can have $4$ different types of attacks : 
## Ciphertext-only attack

The attacker is assumed to only have access to a set of *ciphertexts*
## Known-plaintext attack

In this case the attacker has knowledge of some pairs of *plaintexts* and *chipertexts* eg $(x',y'), (x'',y'')$
## Chosen-plaintext attack (CPA)

Presumes that the attacker can ask and obtain the *ciphertext* for some given *plaintext*
## Chose-chipertext attack (CCA)

Presumes that the attacker can ask and obtain the *plaintext* for some given *ciphertext*
