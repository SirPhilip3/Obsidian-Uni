When using [[Block ciphers]] we may need to *encrypt* *plaintexts* that are **longer** than the block size 

There are various *mode of operation* that repeatedly applies the [[Block ciphers]] selected and allows for the *ecryption* of *plaintexts* of arbitrary size 

## Electronic CodeBook mode (ECB)

## Cipher Block Chaining mode (CBC)

## Output FeedBack mode (OFB)

## Counter mode (CTR)

## Cipher FeedBack mode (CFB)
