*Data Encryption Standard* ( *DES* ) is a [[Ciphers#Symmetric Ciphers|Symmetric]] key algorithm 

The *block size* is $64$ bits 
The *key* is of $64$ bits but $8$ are used for *error correction* ( so in reality the key is only of $56$ bits )
## Encryption

The *encryption scheme* is constituted of $16$ identical *rounds* of a **Feistel function** ( $F$ ) opened and closed by , respectively : 
+ **Initial Permutation** ( $IP$ )
+ **Final Permuation** ( $FP$ )
