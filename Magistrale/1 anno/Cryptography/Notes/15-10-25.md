perfect cipher

all prob equal = no infomration for the attacker

[[Legge di Bayes]]

x = plaintext, y = ciphertext
$$P_p(x|y) = \frac{P_p(x)P_c(y|x)}{P_c(y)}$$

P_p(a|3) = $P_p(a)*P_c(3|a)/P_c(3)$ = 0 
P_p(b|3) = $P_p(b)*P_c(3|b)/P_c(3)$ = 1
ideally 1/2 both

$P_p(a)*P_c(1|a)/P_c(1) = \frac{3/4*1/2}{3/8}= 1$

pc2a -> prob of the key

**def**
a cipher is perfect iff $P_p(x|y) = P_p(x)$ for all x and y -> if the attacker sees a y the prob of some x is equal for all x -> find cunter example to det if a cipher is not perfect
example
P(a|1) != P(a) -> 1 != 3/4 or P(a|3) = 0
P(b|3) != p(b) -> 1 != 1/4 b|2 does not work
