perfect cipher

all prob equal = no infomration for the attacker

[[Legge di Bayes]]

x = plaintext, y = ciphertext
$$P_p(x|y) = \frac{P_p(x)P_c(y|x)}{P_c(y)}$$

P_p(a|3) = $P_p(a)*P_c(3|a)/P_c(3)$ = 0 
P_p(b|3) = $P_p(b)*P_c(3|b)/P_c(3)$ = 1
ideally 1/2 both

$P_p(a)*P_c(1|a)/P_c(1) = \frac{3/4*1/2}{3/8}= 1$

pc2a -> prob of the key

**1 def**
a cipher is perfect iff $P_p(x|y) = P_p(x)$ for all x and y -> if the attacker sees a y the prob of some x is equal for all x -> find cunter example to det if a cipher is not perfect
example
P(a|1) != P(a) -> 1 != 3/4 or P(a|3) = 0
P(b|3) != p(b) -> 1 != 1/4 b|2 does not work

example perfect cipher 

shift cipher -> k changes at every step with a prob for each letter 1/26
proof 

P(y|x) need to be eq p(y) so it liminates with denominator

$P_c(y) = \sum P_k(k) P_p(D_k(y))$
prob of the key the same for every value = 1/26
$= 1/26 \sum P_p(D_k(y))$
$\sum P_p(D_k(y))$ needs to give 1 -> D_k = with the one of the shift cipher
$\sum P_p(y-k\mod{26})$ by def $y-k\mod{26} = x$ 
$\sum P_p(x)$ -> should be 1 -> global prob = 1  
$1/26 * 1$

now $P_c(y|x) = \sum p_k(k) = p_k(y-x \mod{26})$ summation removed since there is one unique k for each specific k and x -> 1 item 
$y-x \mod{26}$ from $E_k(x)$ 

all the keys has 1/26 prob so $P_c(y|x)= 1/26$ than -> $p_p(x|y) = p_p(x)$ -> perfect cipher


**2 th**
a cipher is perfect if we can generate all ciphertext and only if |K|>=|P| 

applying it to a shift cipher $|k| = 26$ , $|p|=26$ 
if a message composed of d items -> not a single item both approaches
