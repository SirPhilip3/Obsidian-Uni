Longer messages -> procedure to extend keys  

at every round of the substitution process is that it get's applied always to a different input matrix 

start with addroundkey -> other rounds subbytes shiftrows mixcolums addroundkey 
last round only subbytes shiftrows addrounf keys

longer messages -> generate a stream of keys from the first one -> number depends on the number of rounds -> each key is generated with similar operation to aes 
4 ( nr of rounds + 1)
each of the keys for each round

decryption 

computed by applying the inverse operations 
invshiftrows -> shift in the other direction 
invsubbytes -> different table
addroundkey same just a xor
invmixcolums -> different matrix mult (inverse matrix)

if you dont run 10 rounds+ you can attack the cipher 

key rec -> best strategies only -2 power operation in respect to the key lenght

example --

100000
