Euler th :
	Let a and n be coprime than $a^{\phi(n)}\mod n = 1$

proof : 
$\phi(n)$ numb of numb cop with n and less n -> $S=(s_1,\dots, s_{\phi(n)})$
and $R=(a \cdot s_1 \mod{n}, \dots, a \cdot s_{\phi(n)}\mod{n})$ proove that $S=R$ 

a -> number coprime with n 

**lemma 1** x, y coprime n -> x * y -> coprime n 
if they not coprime some number must divide both 
should be that at least x or y have that common divisor with n -> this is impossible since x and y are coprime with n

bc we have $a\cdot s_1$

*lemma 2*

be x coprime n -> x \mod n -> coprime to n 

$x \mod{n} = x -k\cdot n$ , k > remainder 

any divisor for x mod n and n must also divide x but x was coprime with n -> so d must be 1 

*lemma 3* : 

a and n coprime and :
$a*x \mod{n}= a*y \mod{n}$ than $x\mod{n}=y \mod{n}$

we can rewrite the reminder in : 
$$
\begin{align}
ax -kn & = ay - jn \\
ax -ay & = kn - jn \\
a(x-y) & = n(k-j) \\
x-y & = \frac{n(w)}{a}
\end{align}
$$
a should either divedi n or (k-j) = w ,
n it cant for coprimality
$x-y = t \cdot n$ 
$(x-y)\mod{n} = t \cdot n \mod{n}$
any mult of n -> 0 for the right part
$x \mod n = y \mod{n}$
$\square$

euler th *proof*

with lemma 1 and 2 than all numbers in $R$ are coprime with $n$ and smaller than $n$ 

a cop with n 
s_1 cop with n 
-> a * s_1 cop with n

than a * s_1 cop with n than a * s_1 \mod n -> cop with n

lemma 3 -> a x mod n = a y mod n  -> x = s_i , y = s_j
than we can write s_i \mod n = s_j \mod n -> since the are in the S list the are unique -> s_i and s_j unique -> than in R -> all s_i are eq to S 

#todo  -> final proof
