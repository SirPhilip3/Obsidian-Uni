Euler th :
	Let a and n be coprime thna $a^{\phi(n)}\mod n = 1$

proof : 
$\phi(n)$ numb of numb cop with n and less n -> $S=(s_1,\dots, s_{\phi(n)})$
and $R=(a \cdot s_1 \mod{n}, \dots, a \cdot s_{\phi(n)}\mod{n})$ proove that $S=R$ 

a -> number coprime with n 

**lemma 1** x, y coprime n -> x * y -> coprime n 
if they not coprime some number must divide both 
should be that at least x or y have that common divisor with n -> this is impossible since x and y are coprime with n

bc we have $a\cdot s_1$

*lemma 2*

be x coprime n -> x \mod n -> coprime to n 

$x \mod{n} = x -k\cdot n$ , k > remainder 

any divisor for x mod n and n must also divide x but x was coprime with n -> so d must be 1
