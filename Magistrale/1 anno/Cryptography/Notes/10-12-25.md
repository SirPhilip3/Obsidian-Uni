birthday attack 

brute force a cryptographic secure hash function -> size of the digest matters -> ex size of 128 bit than the number of times to find a collision is : 

$k \approx 1.17\sqrt{n} = 1.17 \sqrt{2^{128}} = 1.17 \cdot 2^{64}$ tries 

message auth codes : authentication with symmetric keys 

MAC takes a message based on simmetric key -> send both the contract and the signature 

check by recomputing it from the original 

mac uses cbc [[Block cipher modes#Cipher Block Chaining mode (CBC)|CBC]] but we want a smaller output -> so we get only the last block 

mimt attack -> sees x and mac(x) -> he can generate -> mac(mac(x)) its like mac(x||0) 

chosen text forgery -> assumes that the attacker can see 2 messages + macs -> only with 1 block messages 

he can generate a new mac of x1 and a string that we want to send 

since we append a new message > the cbc only fits size n > we need to run it another time from the start 

-> obtained mac > valid for the x1 || z 

hmac > hash based mac 

[[HMAC]]

since symmetric key system > not non repudation since both can generate the same mac 

protocols 

maintaining auth -> tockens 
strong auth > authenticating without showing secret 
we can replay the same encrypted message (encrypted password) 

challenge and response protocol 

seqA -> sequence number of A -> counter of messages send between each other ? -> reciever knows what seq number are used so replay if he resees it it rejects it 

system crash > seq number are lost ? -> resync 

instead of a seq number use a synced clock -> accept only time in a window of time depending on speed of network + buffer to check for doubled messages 

nonce -> number used only once -> b needs to send the nonce not encrypted and tahn a necrypt A and nonce under secret key -> reuse not allowed 

guessing the nonce
