birthday attack 

brute force a cryptographic secure hash function -> size of the digest matters -> ex size of 128 bit than the number of times to find a collision is : 

$k \approx 1.17\sqrt{n} = 1.17 \sqrt{2^{128}} = 1.17 \cdot 2^{64}$ tries 

message auth codes : authentication with symmetric keys 

MAC takes a message based on simmetric key -> send both the contract and the signature 

check by recomputing it from the original 

mac uses cbc [[Block cipher modes#Cipher Block Chaining mode (CBC)|CBC]] but we want a smaller output -> so we get only the last block 

mimt attack -> sees x and mac(x) -> he can generate -> mac(mac(x)) its like mac(x||0) 

chosen text forgery -> assumes that the attacker can see 2 messages + macs -> only with 1 block messages 

he can generate a new mac of x1 and a string that we want to send 

since we append a new message > the cbc only fits size n > we need to run it another time from the start 

-> obtained mac > valid for the x1 || z 

hmac > hash based mac
