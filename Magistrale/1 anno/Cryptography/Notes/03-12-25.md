rsa attacks 

chosen ciphertext attack 
we have an oracle that sends us the decription -> we get to chose which text to decript 

attacker : picks random number between 1 and n -> r needs to be invertible 

attacker asks for decryption of y1 = y' E(r) mod n where y' is the original message 

we obtain the following decryption x1 = x' r mod n 

message must be smaller than the modulos -> otherwise we cant distinguish between all the possibilities -> so the mod is useless 

signatures 

has to change over time > way of verifying that its really you 
avoiding that someone could copy my signature 

secret key used to sign something > encrypting a signature with the private key the verifier just decrypts with public key 

sign_sk(x) -> generate signaure y with private key for x
ver_pk(x,y) > x is what we want to send
