primality test 

we just need 2 prime numbers the sieve finds all -> for smallest rsa modulud 2^3072 

miller rabin test 

non deterministic is non bias monte carlo test -> if it says that a number is not prime than correct otherwise small cahce of mistake -> 1/4 probability 

run multiple times if tells no yes -> re doit than 1/4^r of error 

complexity will be log^3 n -> log n mult with each cost of log^2 n 

test -> 
1. write n-1 than decompose to the biggest power of 2 multiplied with whatever is left for 6 -> 2^1 * 3 -> k=1 , m=3
2. pick random number between 1 and n 
3. write b = a^m \mod n 
4. if b=1 return true -> number is prime
5. otherwise for loop in k 
6. if b is n-1 return true 
7. b = b\*b \mod n 
8. return false if never returned true 

useless to run if even number as input 

proof of non biasedness no is always true :

assume by contradiction that we get a false but the number is prime 
we need to pass all the previous tests 
initially b not 1 
everytime i square b was not n-1 

b = a^m \mod n != 1 from the first test 
b = b * b \mod n-> a^2m \mod n != n-1 from the second test 
for each time we go in the loop it will be
