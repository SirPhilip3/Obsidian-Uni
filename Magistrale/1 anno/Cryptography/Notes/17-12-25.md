in symmetric key ciphers -> intermediary that distributes keys Key Distribution Center

in public cryptography Certification Authority CA

who wants to communicate with bob > asks KDC for connection with B (using key known to everyone fro the KDC) -> gives session key 

x.509

sym key certificates -> creates certificates that user has a key with a certain lifetime 

Asymmetric key settings -> we need to prove that a public key belongs to a certain user > using certs -> Certificate Authority -> certificate the authenticety of a key -> every user will have certificate with the public key > generate by CA 

CA -> signs with the private key of the CA than everyone can check with pk the authenticity
