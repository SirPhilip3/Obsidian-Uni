commutative propiety of idempotent ciphers : S1 x S2 = S2 x S1

**AES** 

3 -> linear operators 1 -> non linear

logher keys -> higher security -> lower performance

works on 2^8 galois field -> all possible bytes -> operation between strings of lenght 8 / polynomials

`11010011` -> $x^7 + x^6 + x^4 + x^1 + x^0$ 

operations : 
+ sum -> bit-wise xor 
+ mult 

mult > result should be vector of $l = 8$  -> standsard mult + reduction

ex : $x^{12}+x^6+x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + x^1$
divide by *irreducible polynomial*  =  $x^8 + x^4 + x^3+ x^1 + 1$ -> just do xor between binary rapresentation of these until we have less than 8th power
