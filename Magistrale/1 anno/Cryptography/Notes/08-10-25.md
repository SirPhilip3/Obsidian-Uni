knowledge based attacks: 

+ known plaintext 
+ chosen plaintext
+ chosen ciphertext

known plaintext -> pairs of ciphertext and corresponding plaintext

chosen-plaintext -> attacker ask oracle the encryption of some plaintext

chosen-ciphertext -> attacker can ask an oracle the decription of some ciphertext

---
known plaintext

matrix m * m  -> we need at least m pairs 
for m=2 2 pairs

$Y = XK\mod{26}$ where Y and X are the matrices of the known ciphertext and plaintext

$$Y = \begin{pmatrix}
19 & 4\\
24 & 11
\end{pmatrix}$$
$$X = \begin{pmatrix}
5 & 9\\
2 & 5
\end{pmatrix}$$
if K is *invertible* we can go back to it 

$$K = X$$
