correctness of RSA 

we need to prove that : 
$D_{SK}(E_{PK}(x)) = (x^b \mod{n})^a \mod{n} = x^{a\cdot b} \mod{n}$ 

so we need to prove that $x^{a \cdot b} \mod{n} = x$

in the rsa we say
$a\cdot b \mod{\phi(n)} = 1 \to a \cdot b = k \cdot \phi(n) +1$ 

than we can replace :
$x^{k \cdot \phi(n)+1} \mod{n} = x^{k \cdot \phi(n)}\cdot x \mod{n}$ 

if x and n have gcd = 1 
per eulers the we have that $x^{\phi(n)} \mod{n} = 1$ -> than elevating it with k still gives us the 1 so sobstituting x = x 

if gcd(x,n) != 1 -> they have a common divisor (n -> p\*q) -> common divisor is p or q 

assume that p is the common divisor 
than $x = j \cdot p$ also gcd(x,q) = 1 since p * q 
per eulers than $x^{\phi(q)} \mod{q} = 1$ 

$x^{\phi(n)} = x^{\phi(p\cdot q)}$
