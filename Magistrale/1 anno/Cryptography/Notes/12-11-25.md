correctness of RSA 

we need to prove that : 
$D_{SK}(E_{PK}(x)) = (x^b \mod{n})^a \mod{n} = x^{a\cdot b} \mod{n}$ 

so we need to prove that $x^{a \cdot b} \mod{n} = x$

in the rsa we say
$a\cdot b \mod{\phi(n)} = 1 \to a \cdot b = k \cdot \phi(n) +1$ 

than we can replace :
$x^{k \cdot \phi(n)+1} \mod{n} = x^{k \cdot \phi(n)}\cdot x \mod{n}$ 

if x and n have gcd = 1 
per eulers the we have that $x^{\phi(n)} \mod{n} = 1$ -> than elevating it with k still gives us the 1 so sobstituting x = x 

if gcd(x,n) != 1 -> they have a common divisor (n -> p\*q) -> common divisor is p or q 

assume that p is the common divisor 
than $x = j \cdot p$ also gcd(x,q) = 1 since p * q 
per eulers than $x^{\phi(q)} \mod{q} = 1$ 

$x^{\phi(n)} = x^{\phi(p\cdot q)} = x^{\phi(p)\phi(q)} \mod{q} =$
than applying eulers to $x^{\phi(q)} \mod{q} = 1 \to 1^{\phi(p)} = 1$

$1^{k}\mod{q} = 1$ 

we can use euler th to get the inverse 

q = 5 
n = 3 * 5 = 15
phi(n) = 8
a = 2 > cant apply since 2 8 not coprime
a = 3
a\*b \mod phi(n) = 1
3 b
phi(8) = 1,3,5,7 = 4
b= 3^n = 3^4 = 27 \mod 8 = 3 -> result 

exponentiation -> repeating moltiplication -> costly if exp is high 

square and multiply -> x^8 can be x\*x... -> we can compact how many times we can square a number to get the result $x^{8}=x^2{^2{^2}}$ 

x^10 -> dived the exponent by 2 x^5^2 recursively do it inside until power of 2 -> if odd x^n-1 x -> x^2^2 x ^2 

write the exponent in binary 10 = 1010_2  start from most significant bit 

if 1 > square everythin and mutiply by the base otherwise only square
