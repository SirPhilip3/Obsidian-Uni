swap if b larger than a

OFB mode

generate a stream of keys mixed with input for randomness 

given k and an initial iv -> use encryption to generate z_1 from those and than xor with input to get y_1 

than reusee at next block z_1 instead of IV (IV needs to be random)

we can precompute the key stream 

decription simply in the xor we swap the data flow 

the key stream -> uses same as cbc 

weekness -> when i encrypt 2 messages with the same IV -> we generate the same key stream -> so if a plaintext is same in some block the ciphertext in that block will be same

IV can be shared in clear

integrity -> if mimt -> the change of 1 block will only propagate to the next block 

CTR mode variant of ofb 

we start with IV(nonce) + counter (increases by for each block encrypted)

CFB -> cipher feedback mode

how we generate x_i -> start with IV very long -> at a genric point we add a y_i to the left and shifts iv to the right by y_i -> each step add the y next 

if IV is big we may put it in the next one 

worse perfomance no parallelism
