## Caesar Cipher

**Encryption** : All the letters of the message are *substituted* by the one $3$ positions ahead in the alphabeth 

>[!example]

In this case the *key* is $3$

**Decription** : This will be the opposite of *encryption* so each letter will go back $3$ positions

>[!warning] 
>Given the [[Kerckhoffs principle]] this algorithm is **insecure** since once we know that we are using a *Ceasar Cipher* we already know the key
