**Search** algorithms are the backbone of AI. They allow the systematic exploration of alternatives 

We can have : 
+ **Uninformed** ( *blind* ) search : 
	We only know the *current state* and states that are reachable through a single action ( the *neighbours* )
+ **Informed** ( *heuristic* ) search : 
	We have means to asses progress toward the *goal* state 

In general a problem in AI can be solved by *reducing* it to a problem that can be attributed to the *search* on a [[Graphs|graph]] 

In order to *reduce* a problem to a graph search :
+ *states* become all the relevant aspects of the problem
+ *actions* become what can be performed on the states
+ *goal test* the condition for success 

>[!example] Trip
>+ *states* : the cities ( ex Vicenza, Padova, Venezia etcc )
>+ *actions* : moving to a new city 
>+ *goal test* : reaching your destination
>``` dot
>graph G {
>	rankdir=LR;
>    Vicenza -- Padova ;
>    Padova -- Treviso ;
>    Treviso -- Venezia;
>    Venezia -- Padova;
>    Venezia [peripheries=2]
>}
>```

## Graph Search

Since we have efficent algorithm to perform the search on a *Tree* we will convert the *graph* in a *tree* in the following way : 

+ Replace undirected links by $2$ directed links ( back and forward )
+ Avoid loops

The resultin *tree* will have numerous duplicated nodes since there may be multiple paths to the same node in the *graph*

## Evaluating

4 criteria to evaluate a *search algorithm* :
+ **Completeness** : will it find a solution if one exists
+ **Optimality** : will the algorithm find the *best* solution if one exists
+ **Temporal Complexity** : time to solution find a solution 
+ **Spatial Complexity** : memory required
