isomap -> maniforld locally are similiar to flat space ->if we calculate long  distance without considering the manifold than wrong distancese but short we a re more correct 

the manifold is considered a graph -> the distance is just the shortest path between two points-> estimated manifold distance -> since distance between two nodes are more correct rispect all 

higher dimension -> holes in the manifold that make the variance larger + constributes to the approximation of curve to linear

we can make prediction about closer objects not distant 

laplacian eigenmap -> mesure the strenght of local connectivity in order to do dimensionality reduction i guess ???? 
+ epsilon neighborhood -> node connected if distance is closer than a given epsilon 
+ n nearest neighbors -> connect if they have n nearest neighbors 

what weights do we give to the connection created ?? 
+ heat kernel -> heat diffusion equation -> depends on the distance
+ simple -> all 1 

search for embedding that penalizes large distances 

invariant in respect to scaling
