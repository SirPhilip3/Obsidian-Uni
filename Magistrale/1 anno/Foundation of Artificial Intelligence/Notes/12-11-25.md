Decision Trees 

decisoion trees can be expressed also in form of logic 

its a descritpion of the data -> its not a predictor since it perfectly describes the data 

to decide continue data just use < > etcc

id3 algorithm 
? which nodes to put in which position
? nodes and leaf nodes

chose a node that give the bigges information gain

accuracy of a single tree bad > large variance -> use an ensamble of trees -> random forest

bootstrap aggergation > bagging-> avergae the result a single tree has high variance 

 changes the data points 

average predicton error reduces -> up to a point -> these trees are still going to be very similar since the avergaing will mean that we select more often the same questions 

split-variable randomization -> we dont just pick the datapoint but also a subset of the attributes available randomly we cant always chose the same attributes 

1/3 of available one -> for regression -> sqrt p for classification
