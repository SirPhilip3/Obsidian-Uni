generative classifiers

now classifier needs only to decide to which class associate an object 

descriminative learning algo -> trained to descriminate from a given number of classes

generative learning algo -> probability of the feature given the class 

we model p(x|y) and p(y) -> y in general a set of classes 

we can have bayes to get c

we can avoid computing p(x) -> since 

difference -> given two classes -> in the discriminative distrivution is more complicated for the two 
 
generative become more complex requireim more data -> we need to come up with the characteristics of each class -> some char are not realted to the other class and not used to discriminate the two 

if we give them a new class -> generative can easly reject an option since it will not have any of the characteristics
