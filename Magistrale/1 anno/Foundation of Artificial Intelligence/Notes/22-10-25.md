huge difference of ighenvalues -> zigzag behaviours

KKT conditions > 
requirements > all derivatives must be continuos and defined on every point 

necessary conditions 
x^* is a local extremum point and x^* is a regular point of these constraint

$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $\mu \ge 0\in \mathbb{R}^p$

first 
equality contrain sol in the border -> 3 points -> gradienat of the constrain is always ortogonal to the surface -> normal vector 

gradient of the objective functions must be aligned with that 

otherwise in "some" direction we can deminish the function

???????????

gradient projection method -> project the rgadient in the tanget to the constraint -> for a small step -> so we can't go too far from the actual constraint function

-> direction of movment ?

penalty methods becomes an unconstrinaned problem but we penailize the algorithm for straing too much from the constraint
