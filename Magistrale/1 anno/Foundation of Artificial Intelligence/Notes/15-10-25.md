constraint satisfaction

variables -> entities that can have multiple values -> domains set of values that can be assigned to variables 

contraint -> each assignments valid in the context of all other assignments to variables

n-queens example -> place n queens so that no queen is threatinng any other queen 

variables -> chess squares 
domain -> queen or blank
contraint > 2 pos in the same line can't have both q 

note not unique mapping 

scheduling example

graph coloring example

Solving constrains progpagation -> it retains the difficulty of the problem 
we can solve by combination of : 
+ constrint propagation -> remove some of the search space
+ search on the remaning 

const prop on binary variables -> arc consistency

eliminates values that can't be in the final solution 

v_i -> v_j -> per tutti gli elmenti in i esiste un valore nel target j in modo che siano legali 

examples : in graph coloring the contraint are between pairs 

for every color on v1 than there is a color in the target node such that it's different from the one selected

v1-v3 -> if we select g in v1 there is no remaining corresponding color in v3 

backtracking -> tree at each level a decision , so.utions always at the last level of the tree 

remove from the tree nodes that break arc consistency 

Forward checking: Do just local propagation from domains with
unique assignments 

ordering is always the same -> v1, v2,v3

dynamic ordering we can do better 
+ most contrained variable -> when i select the next variable to assign we select the one with the fewer legal values assigned to it smalles domain -> we defer large domain later hoping that they will be reduced after 
+ least contrained variable -> ordering on values -> pick the one that removes the fewest values from neighbours -> in the opposite direction -> generally the larger subtree is the one that will have a solution 

local search 

turn the contrain satisfactions problems into optimization problems 

create a min function :
+ positive 
+ 0 if contrain satisfied 

n-queen 

h = nÂ° of pairs of queens attacking each other 

use gradient descent -> hill climbing algorihm -> local minimum finding
