Uniform cost search

optimality we need to take into account the fact that some operation may have higher cost

from $L$ get the node with the minimal path lenght from the root -> implemented with heap 

assume that action can't have a lesser cost in respect to epsilon minimum 
each node will be asisgned a cost and will keep the path with minimum cost 

when every action has the same cost -> like BST 

special complexity -> exponenctial in the worst case like BST

level depends on the cost not on the depth

there is no simple way to di like with iterative deepening if not with an approximation -> procede band by band don't stop at the goal return the minimum cost solution

Heuristics 
---

exploit a goodness mesure to guide the search , there is no garantee 

$h'(node)$ assigna estimate of the optimal path lenght from n to goal
$h'>0$ , $h'=0$ only if n is the goal

greedy search -> best first search always extrac the node with the lowest heuristic value

complete ? : could get stuck if the node have a loop of minimum distance while the destination has a larger heuristic

optimal ? : we can have lots of steps with low heuristics but maybe at the start we had higher heuristics wih lower steps  NO

$A*$ 

uniform cost + heuristic search 

eval function $f(n) = g(n)+h'(n)$
g(n) -> path lenght from the root to n 
$h'(n)$ heuristic prediction of cost from n to goal

still if it can be not optimal if for example goal at 5 

*Consistent heuristics*

triangular inequality 

h'(n) is always an under estimate of the real distance h(n)

th if the heuristic is consisten than A* is optimal 
let s be an optimal goal and x non optimal node we want to show that we will expand an optimal goal before we expand x 

n_0 to n_k path to s from root we want to show that f(n_i) < f(x)
