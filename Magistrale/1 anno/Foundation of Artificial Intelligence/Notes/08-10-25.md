**Adversarial search** 

multiple actors -> with competing goals 
you can't controlyour opponents moves -> certain operations are beyond your control 

you can't search the full search path -> it depends on the opponent actions

the opponent can make actions that invalidate your solutions ??? 

strategy that lead to winning indipendently of the opponent actions
strategly = solution

we may have limited knowledge of the actions that can be performed by the opponent


2-player zero-sum (opponent win = my loss, my win = his loss) discrete finite deterministic games of perfect information

mapping a game to tree search :
+ intial state -> initial board state
+ operators -> one move each for each legal move 
+ goal -> winning board position
+ scorin +1 win 0 draw -1 loss
