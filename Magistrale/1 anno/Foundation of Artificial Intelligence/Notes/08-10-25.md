**Adversarial search** 

multiple actors -> with competing goals 
you can't controlyour opponents moves -> certain operations are beyond your control 

you can't search the full search path -> it depends on the opponent actions

the opponent can make actions that invalidate your solutions ??? 

strategy that lead to winning indipendently of the opponent actions
strategly = solution

we may have limited knowledge of the actions that can be performed by the opponent


2-player zero-sum (opponent win = my loss, my win = his loss) discrete finite deterministic games of perfect information

mapping a game to tree search :
+ intial state -> initial board state
+ operators -> one move each for each legal move 
+ goal -> winning board position
+ scorin +1 win 0 draw -1 loss

minimax algo : 
generate the whole game tree -> we get a utility function depending on the situation we take the action that minimizes or maximises this value
min -> first opponent , max -> me 

n-ply > n = depth search -> 2 muves

Maximizes utility under assumption that opponent will play
perfectly to minimize it 

assuming opponent does its best 

given cutoff limits (cutoff test) 

$\alpha-\beta$ pruning -> will not effect the final result

remove useless nodes of the tree 

when finding the node to prone depends on the order of pruning -> with perferct ordering we can go 2 times as deep 

non deterministic games -> each move is labeled by a probability -> like a third player

the outcome of a move depends on chance happening with some probability 

expectation on the third layer
