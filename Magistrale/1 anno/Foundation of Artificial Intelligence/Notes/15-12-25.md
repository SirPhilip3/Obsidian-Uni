limits of PCA 

direction of the projection is important 

fisher terminal -> maximazie the ratio between the difference of the man and the difference of the variance 

pca gives a new base where information would like to be as independent as possible but its not

pcs fails for more than one principal direction

ica -> independent component analysis

cocktail party problem 

we want to extract original audio file from mixed ones 

sources needs to be independent and have nongaussian distribution 

we can't determine the volume we can't do dimensionality reduction because we would lose information 

independen e is > minimazise gaussianity / maximazies non gaussianity -> average closer and closer to gaussian 

lot's of mesure that gives us a mesure gaussianity of data distribution 

multidimensional data -> easier to get distance instead of having a vectorial rapresentation of the data 

square distances -> dot prodocut between the - between the two -> assume that the sum of all of these disntace is 0 

translation doesnt change the data -> we recontract the data where the trnaslation is at the center 

create gram matrix $G$ -> matrix of dot product expressed through distances -> we dont have garantuee that $G$ is positive semidefinite > so it must be positive with rank smaller than m -> we can emb
