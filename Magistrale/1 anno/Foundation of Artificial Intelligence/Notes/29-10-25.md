automated reasoning

tautologies -> sentences true no metter what thruth value we put for each variable

inference rules can be for commutativity , associativity and distributivity
de morgan laws , contraposition 

less stringent than rewrite rules -> entailments -> modus ponens
we have A implies B and we have A than we can generate B

and-elimination -> sentence conjunction (and) of different A  is true than we can extract one and it will be true 

and-introduction -> if i nÃ¬know that each A is independently true than we can conjunct them togheter into a unique statements

or-introduction -> given on A is true than we can write or and it will be true

unit resolution we have A or B and no B than we have A 

universal elimination 

if A is valid for any value of V than we can sobstitute V to any value g and it is automatically true  

esistential elimination 

given sentecne A we create a compleatly new symbol k and sob V with it as long as k is constant 

existential introduction 

given A we can add any variable V not used in A ???

$\exists V. V \neq g$ if we use V $\exists V. \exists V\ V \neq V$ -> different variable $\exists x. \exists V\ V \neq x$

chain of inference 

3 possibilities :
+ forward chaining -> what can i produce from the start
+ backward chaining -> what could have produced the th 
+ proof by contradiction

Theorem Proving 

prove T from axioms Ax and a set of inference rules R 
$A |= B$  A entails B 
$A |- B$ we can derive B from A using R 

R is sound if every time $A |- B$ than $A |= B$  
R is complete -> every time A entails B if A produce  B everything correct can be produces

transform into conjunctive normal form 
$(A \lor B)\land (\lnot A \lor C) \land(B \lor C)$ 
into set 3 sentences $A \lor B$ , $\lnot A \lor C$ , $B \lor C$

skolemisation ->

X for C bu we already sub X with ftony so also C to ftony
