coin toss generalizes perfectly the problem 

higher variance higher accuracy in the training but lower generalization -> simpler model instead may have lower accuracy in the training but given more data it may need to change less to fit the new data -> higher generalization 

size of data grows -> reduction in variance 

how to choose a loss function 

minimize expected classification error -> assign x to the class that has the highest density 

we need a loss function that capture the problem itself -> capturin something regarding user perception -> impossible

testing data -> thnigs never been used by the algo 

test error -> average error in test set by the algo trained in on testing set 

larger trainig -> better classifier (2/3)
larger test -> more accurate error estimate (1/3)

build classifier using the training and evaluating it with test set 

selection tuning parameter -> done with the training data 
+ adding a validation dataset to optimize this parameters

handling unbalanced data -> build a balanced trainig set -> select the minority class and than balance the majority class by selecting random

the evaluation gives us the performance of tha single predictor not of the algorithm 

cross-validation -> split of training set  in different part and perform validation and training n times

k-fold cross validation
leave one out cross validation -> remove one k and train on the remaining k-1 folds we will have k different values of the performance predictor we take the best one -> the one with lower error

linear classifiers 

if the data can be split with a linear separator -> data is linearly separable 

not linearly separable > larger hypotesis space or allow some bias 

how we rapresent an hypotesys -> equation with n+1 values  and w coefficeints + a scalar values 

the weights form a vectro perpendicular to the hyperplane -> b proportional to the perpendicular distance from the origin of the linear separator 

equation $w\cdot x + b = 0$ 

add a new dimension so tahta $x_{n+1} = 1$ and $w_{n+1}= b$ so that equation becomes simply $w\cdot x = 0$
