knowledge rapresentation 
symbolic approaches 

agents need to deal with data 

expert system 

rule based pc that simulates a human expert in his/her field of expertise -> knowledge of a human expert described in rules 

characteristics : actions based on the goals that hte system must achieve 

always clear why they gave theyr decision 

limits cant gain any more experience , cant cope with unseen info, cant cope with noise, cant adapt to the environment

LOGICAL RAPRESENTATION

logic = any language with concrete rules (no ambiguity) 

logic = language , reasoning > a process over the logic language 

syntax -> how we construct the logic sentence
semantic -> interprets the sentence to a meaning 

sentence may be valid but not correct

propositional logic 
1. proposition -> facts 
2. connections -> and or implies , iff 
3. brackets ,ordering , true and false 

semantics classic boolean logic

predicate logic 
allows to add propieties to object
is_wet(today) -> propieties function from objects to t f
relations -> propieties of multiple objects likes(john , apple)
each atom a predicate 

first order logic

functions -> from objects to other objects fruit_of(apple_tree)
variables -> and quantifiers $\forall, \exists$ 

higher order logic
functions are also objects we can quantify functions

beyond true and false -> multi value logics -> mesure of thruthfulness
fuzzy logic -> cox th -> under general condition each fuzzy logic > equivalent prob model 

production rules -> if condition than action

graph reasoning
structure suggest something 

equivalent to logical rapresentation -> easier to understand > we can do some inference 

conceptual graphs -> nodes can rapresent fact or abstaract concept

frame rapresentation

AUTOMATED REASONING

large rules from general to specific deduction 

automated th proving 
search of a path from rules to proof

infrence rules 

A entails B iff B is true when A is true , any model of A is a model of B

deals just with semantics 
inference rule -> every time we have A we can create B

we apply inference rules from the axiom until we have a th
this over strings 

digit map to number -> sequence of operation so that the resulting number is the sum of the two original number
