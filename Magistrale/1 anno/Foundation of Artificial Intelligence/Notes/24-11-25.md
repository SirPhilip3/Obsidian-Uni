deep learning

for hierarchical data -> differentiable function programming

backpropagation -> automaticaally learn differentaible functional programming 

learned convolutions -> at the lower level easier features (like learning linear function) , higher we go we get more detailed features like mid could be part of a face high a complete face 

computation -> directed graph of functions depending on some weights

tensor -> an array generalization , operator -> operation takes 2 tensors and performs some operations 

operators can be linear (parametrized function) or non linear 
differentiation is just an  application of the chain rule
