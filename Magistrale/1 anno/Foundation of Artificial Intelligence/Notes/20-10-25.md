local search 

local beam search -> keeps track of $k$ states -> if one is goal state stop otherwise select the next $k$ best successors from  the list and repeat 

if we select only the k best it maybe that you search only a local minimum -> varibility of the starting point 

*genetic algorithm*

in creating successors we recombine more than one solution 
operati directly on the rapresentation of the state -> in string on an alphabet
