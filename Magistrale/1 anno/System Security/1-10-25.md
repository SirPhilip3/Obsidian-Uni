design principle 

simple vs complex 
+ economy of mechanism -> easily maintanable

permission vs exclusion 
+ better from inside out 
fail safe default 

optimization 
+ early exit could lead to data leaks 
+ caching

complete mediation -> every access should check auth every time its accessed 

open vs closed design 
+ open = share design

separation of privileges : privilege attributes are required to achieve a sensitive task -> multiple people for one sesitive action 

least privileges , for each application only the thing that they srictly need  

multiple protection -> layering

usability -> if sec is too low usability they may not accept sec

isolation -> for digital signature provider only on local devices 

modular -> easier to control 

Strategy
---

+ policy

consider what is more important to protect , what are the possible "intrusion" routes etcc  
legal requirements
+ implementation

phisical solutions

+ correctness

test the system 

form the bottom up -> each possible attack makes upper attacks possible  

Implementation
---

prevention 
detection
response
recovery 

Correctness
---

pen testing 
formal analysis of a system

evaluation -> common criteria to certify a deterined product to a certain level of assurance
