design principle 

simple vs complex 
+ economy of mechanism -> easily maintanable

permission vs exclusion 
+ better from inside out 
fail safe default 

optimization 
+ early exit could lead to data leaks 
+ caching

complete mediation -> every access should check auth every time its accessed 

open vs closed design 
+ open = share design

separation of privileges : privilege attributes are required to achieve a sensitive task -> multiple people for one sesitive action 

least privileges
