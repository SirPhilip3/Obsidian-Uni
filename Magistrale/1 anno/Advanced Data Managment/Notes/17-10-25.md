how to restore data 

blocks of rdbms 
split between data model and storage engine

relational engine -> 

storage engine > how we store data 
persistante memory manager -> virtualization of the storage -> we can access data through linear address 

most of teh choiches made when db stored in magnetic disk latency = moving the disk and head in the correct position than we tranfer as fast a the disk rotates etcc

we can put a baffer to store a single page of the disk

we can store data in a file , knowinfÃ¬g that the cost of accesing a bit in the file is the cost of the latency in order to access a page on the disk

a record -> perfect for key value store a prefix and field

all the element on a row in mongodb

record stored in a page and we need a way to refer to position inside a page 

file structures : serial -> append data at the end of a file -> we don't know where things are based on the content -> where is the record of the jungher person > make data permanent but we can't access it efficently 

sequential data ordered by specific field -> update cost is heavy

storing by row we can't easily access data on a column, 1 file for each column if i need to update a whole person i need to recombine the files for each column 

row store -> 1 record after another 
why column store much more evident in nosql dbs 

in datawherhauses could be beneficial 

column store -> the data is written by column , in most cases stored separatly

advantages we can get only relevant data to a current query + since all values on the same column same domain -> easier to compress them since they are similar, computing velues over a column we can just access a single column not an advantage if we need all the column

new colum simply new file 

insering row = change all colum stores 

column compression

we are intrested in *lossless* compression 

1 - run lenght encoding -> exploit presence of repetition in order to have more compact -> shorter rappresentation -> repetitions but not consecutivies -> Claudio = C , another une C+1, or difference between

value + start + lenght -> so that we can reconstruct from any point and start reconstracting from that point 

2 bit vector
or we can store the presence of that value if we have only a small amount of different values 
easly compute bitways operations

3 dictionary encoding 
replace whole values with something that can be stored more efficently ex 1 for 204 we also need to store the dictionary

some queries dont need the dictionary number fo unique el 

if the dictionary doesn't compleatly fit in memory things maybe different in term of efficency 

we could also store the dictionary encoding for sequences
