neo4j -> cypher query language 

in general goal of a query to find path or stats about the path

Cypher -> patter matching query language

like regexp -> `C(.*)ab$` several possibilities : `CCCab` -> depending on where we start we can have different results 

its declaratieve -> we specify which pattern we are interested in 
`:` to mark types 

`(:Person{name:"Dan"}) - [:LOVES] -> (:Person{name:"Ann"})`

Add CREATE to add new nodes and patterns 

`CREATE(:Person{name:"Dan"}) - [:LOVES] -> (:Person{name:"Ann"})`

variable -> to return what we are interestes -> every possible path from dan to someone else with rel loves -> the return is not necessary a person

`MATCH(:Person{name:"Dan"}) - [:LOVES] -> (whom) RETURN whom`

we can add contraints like what types of node we want returned 

we can return a subgraph

() -> node
--> / -[]-> relationship

return -> we can return any variables that we specified in the pattern 
```cypher
MATCH (m:Movie)
RETURN m

MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p, r, m

MATCH path = (:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)
RETURN path
```
