graph db 

graph theory -> nodes and edges -> each a pair of nodes 
directed order has a meaning or undirected

multigraph-> more edges between 2 nodes

hypergraph -> same edge connects more than 2 nodes

adjecency -> share an edge -> order is significant -> oneadjecent to another but not the contrary 
incidence -> ..... -> edge incident node -> connected to the node ....

graph-trasversal 

verifiying propieties like find paths or extract data 

edges rapresents diffrent thins in respect to what we are modeling , we want to attach information to nodes and edges 

problems solvable through graphs 

during the transvelsa we can verify some propieties 
eulerian path every node without visiting every edge more than

rapresent relation not contrained by single relation rapresentation of RDBMS 
social networks , gis > road networks , recommender systems

property graph model -> based on directed multigraph each pair of nodes may have more than 1 edge that connect them

key value data on nodes or more complex structures -> generally a key to identifiy each node 
for edges we get key:value pairs we have type / class of nodes and vertices (label on vertices)

generally same class = same set of attributes 

several edges between a pair of nodes -> 1 constraint nodes with more than 1 edge all of the connecting edge each one with different labels 

how to store in memory -> 

store an edge and vertex set 

ez to add edge -> difficult to delete since we may need to recompact or do logical deletion

adjacency matrix -> rapresents that there is an edge connecting 2 nodes -> matrix 
undirected -> simmetric matrix

directed -> on the diagonal -> connected to itself in the two ways 

multigraph -> number that indicate the number of edges 
adjacency quick check for exisance of n edge 
ez insertion 

costly to add a new node -> reshape the matrix -> in memory linearized array 

finding if pair of vertices is adjacent just ez lookup while fniding all adjacent verteces -> looking at the whole row but it can contain lots of 0

alternatively we can rapresent incidency -> we have columns edges and rows vertices -> 1 for the 2 edges that connected throu
