>We can transmit any information with $2$ *bits* given syncronized clocks

We simply send at time $t$ one bit to the reciever , than wait the units of time relative to the value to be send and send a different at time $t+x$ to the reciever 

The reciever will recieve the first bit at time $t' = t+1$

And the second bit at time $t'' = t+x+1$ , the final number recieved will be :

## Speed improvments 

To improve the time that it takes to send a message we thus need to lower the time that it takes to "count" ( the time between the first and second bit ) the number

### time = $\lfloor x/2 \rfloor$ , bits = 2

We can associate a meaning to the first and second bit 

The *sender* :
+ Send a bit $b_0$ to the reciever to start counting
+ Wait $\lfloor x/2 \rfloor$ units of time 
+ Send a bit $b_1$ where :
$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
      0 \text{ if $x$ is even} \\
      1 \text{ if $x$ is odd}
    \end{cases}\
\end{equation}
$$
The *reciever* :
+ Recieves $b_0$ and starts counting
+ Recieves $b_1$ stops counting and decodes the value with the following equation : $$x = 2 (t'' - t')+b_1$$
>[!example] 
>$x = 7$ 
>*sender* :
>1. sends $b_0$
>2. waits $3$
>3. sends $b_1 = 1$ 
>
>*reciever* :
>
>
>1. recieves $b_0$ at time $t'$
>2. recieves $b_1=1$ at time $t'' = t'+3$
>3. $x=2\cdot 3 +1 = 7$

### time = $\lfloor x/4 \rfloor$ , bits = 2

The *sender* : 
+ Send bit $b_1$ at time $t$ where :
$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
      0 \text{ if $x$ is even} \\
      1 \text{ if $x$ is odd}
    \end{cases}\
\end{equation}
$$
+ Wait $\lfloor x/4 \rfloor$ units of time 
+ Send bit $b_2$ where :
$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
      0 \text{ if $\lfloor x/2 \rfloor$ is even} \\
      1 \text{ if $\lfloor x/2 \rfloor$ is odd}
    \end{cases}\
\end{equation}
$$

The *reciever* :
+ Recieves $b_1$ at time $t_1$
+ Recieves $b_2$ at time $t_2$ and decodes the value with the following equation : $$x = 2 \cdot(2\cdot (t_2 - t_1) + b_2) + b_1$$
>[!example] 
>$x = 7$ 
>*sender* :
>1. sends $b_1=1$
>2. waits $1$
>3. sends $b_2 = 1$

>*reciever* :

>
>1. recieves $b_1$ at time $t_1$
>2. recieves $b_1=1$ at time $t_2 = t_1+1$
>3. $x=2\cdot (2\cdot (1) +1)+1 = 7$

>We could go like this to improve the speed of the algorithm by dividing the message and than using the bits to reconstruct the message

# 3-bit Communication

We use 3 messages to reduce even more the time to wait to encode the message 

*sender* : 
1. send the initial bit
2. wait for $\lceil\sqrt{x} \rceil$ 
3. send another bit
4. wait for $\lceil \sqrt{x} \rceil ^2 - x$ 
5. send another bit

*reciever* : 
1. recieves the first bit at time $t'$
2. recieves the second bit at time $t''$ 
3. compute $t''-t'$
4. recieve the final bit at time $t'''$
5. compute $t'''-t''$ 
6. decode the number : $$(t'' -t')^2-(t'''-t'')$$
>[!note] 
>The *time* complexity will be $O(\lceil\sqrt{x} \rceil)$

>[!example] 
>$x=23$
>*sender* : 
>1. sends $b_0$
>2. wait $q_0 = \lceil\sqrt{23} \rceil = 5$
>3. send $b_1$
>4. wait $q_1 = \lceil \sqrt{23} \rceil ^2 - 23 = 2$
>5. send $b_2$

>The decoded number will be : $(6-1)^2 - (8-6) = 25 -2 = 23$

# k-bit Communication

We can generalize the previous protocolo using $k$ bits 

The *time complexity* will be : $$O(\lceil k X^{1/k}\rceil)$$
# Pipeline Communication

If we need to communicate at a distance we have two possibilities : 
+ By replicating the comunication between two entities directly connected on all the pairs of entities 
>[!example] 
>
>![[NoPipe.excalidraw.png]]
>%%[[NoPipe.excalidraw.md|ğŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw]]%%
+ By using **pipeline** we just propagate the bits recieved to the next entity until it arrives at it's destination

## Communicate Maximum with Pipeline

To comunicate the maximum to an entity with the *pipeline* :
1. Wait your own value 
2. If the next entity has a greater value than the waiting time between the first and second bit than it will add to the delay the difference between it's value and the current delay 
3. The result will be the dealy of the initial bit minus the delay of the second bit
