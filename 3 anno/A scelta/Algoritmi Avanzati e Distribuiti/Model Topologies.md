# 2-dimensional mesh

A *2D meshes* is a $X \times Y$ grid with each *node* having a distinct label $(x,y)$ ( where $0 \leq x \leq X-1$ and $0 \leq y \leq Y-1$ ) 

We have 3 types of nodes :
+ The ones on the 4 edges with $2$ connections each
+ The ones on the sides with $3$ connections each
+ All the other one with $4$ connections each

>[!note] 
>A switch that has label $(0\leq x < X-1, 0 \leq y < Y-1)$ will always be connected to swithces $(x,y+1), (x,y-1),(x+1,y),(x-1,y)$

>[!example] 
# 3-dimensional mesh

Same as per *2D meshes* but now each node has label $(x,y,z)$

# Torus network

A *torus* is a *2D mesh* that has the connections between the border *nodes* completed with the opposite *node*
