# The Problem



# Algo


broadcast problem : -> 1 entity wants to share with eveyone

everybody should recieve the information 

restricitions : 
+ unique initiator -> one entity starts everything
+ Graph connected -> entities will not recieve the info
+ Total reliability -> can be solved without
+ bidirectional links -> can be solved without

--
spontaneus impulse event -> the external event that start the algo 
we can not write the state that will do nothing as it will be implicit
