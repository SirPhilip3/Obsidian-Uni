`assert()` is a function that takes in input a boolean value (it can be determined by an expression example: `assert( y == 34 )` ) 

Use assert to check for pre/post conditions of a function

Insert `#include <cassert>` in the header file to include assert functions in source files

The compiler fails on the first failed assert
